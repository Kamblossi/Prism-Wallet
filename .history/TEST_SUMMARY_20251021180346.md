## âœ… Configuration Verified - Ready to Test

### Current Status

All configurations have been verified and are correct:

âœ… **PHP-FPM Configuration** (`docker/php/www.conf`)
   - Listening on: `127.0.0.1:9000` âœ“

âœ… **Nginx Main Config** (`nginx.conf`)
   - FastCGI pass: `127.0.0.1:9000` âœ“

âœ… **Nginx Default Config** (`nginx.default.conf`)
   - FastCGI pass: `127.0.0.1:9000` âœ“

âœ… **Enhanced Startup Script** (`startup.sh`)
   - Comprehensive error messages âœ“
   - Config validation before starting âœ“
   - Active wait for PHP-FPM readiness âœ“
   - Clear section markers and status indicators âœ“

âœ… **Debug Tools Added**
   - `validate-deployment.sh` - Local testing script âœ“
   - `debug-startup.sh` - In-container diagnostics âœ“
   - `DEPLOYMENT_TESTING.md` - Complete guide âœ“

## Next Steps - Testing Workflow

### Option 1: Quick Local Test (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the automated validation
./validate-deployment.sh
```

This will build, start, and validate everything automatically.

### Option 2: Manual Docker Test

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t prism-wallet:test .

# Run without database (just to test startup)
docker run -d -p 8080:80 \
  -e DB_HOST=localhost \
  -e DB_PORT=5432 \
  -e DB_NAME=test \
  -e DB_USER=test \
  -e DB_PASSWORD=test \
  -e AUTH_PROVIDER=local \
  -e APP_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  --name prism-test \
  prism-wallet:test

# Watch the startup logs
docker logs -f prism-test

# You should see:
# ===================================
# Prism Wallet Container Starting
# ===================================
# âœ“ PHP-FPM started with PID: XXX
# âœ“ PHP-FPM is ready and accepting connections
# âœ“ Nginx started with PID: XXX
# ===================================
# Startup Complete - Services Running
# ===================================

# Test the container
curl http://localhost:8080/health.php

# Run diagnostics
docker exec prism-test /usr/local/bin/debug-startup.sh

# Cleanup when done
docker stop prism-test && docker rm prism-test
```

### Option 3: Test with Docker Compose

```bash
# Uses your existing docker-compose.yaml with PostgreSQL
docker compose up --build

# Watch logs
docker compose logs -f

# Test
curl http://localhost:8080/health.php

# Cleanup
docker compose down
```

## What Changed and Why

### The Problem
Render was getting: **"host not found in upstream 'php-fpm'"**

This happens when:
- Nginx tries to connect to a hostname `php-fpm`
- But PHP-FPM is in the same container (not a separate service)
- DNS resolution fails because there's no host called `php-fpm`

### The Solution

1. **PHP-FPM listens on loopback TCP** instead of Unix socket
   - `listen = 127.0.0.1:9000` in `www.conf`
   - Guaranteed to work in single-container setups

2. **Nginx connects via IP, not hostname**
   - `fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000` everywhere
   - No DNS lookup needed

3. **Startup script validates everything**
   - Tests configs before starting services
   - Waits for PHP-FPM to actually be ready
   - Shows clear error messages if anything fails

4. **Better logging and error handling**
   - Non-fatal handling for minor issues
   - Clear success/failure indicators
   - Detailed diagnostics available on demand

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Startup
```
===================================
Prism Wallet Container Starting
Date: Mon Oct 21 12:34:56 UTC 2025
===================================
âœ“ www.conf exists
âœ“ php-fpm configuration test PASSED
===================================
Starting PHP-FPM
===================================
âœ“ PHP-FPM started with PID: 15
===================================
Waiting for PHP-FPM to Listen
===================================
âœ“ PHP-FPM is ready and accepting connections on 127.0.0.1:9000
===================================
Starting Nginx
===================================
âœ“ Nginx configuration is valid
âœ“ Nginx started with PID: 23
===================================
Startup Complete - Services Running
===================================
PHP-FPM PID: 15
Nginx PID:   23
Crond PID:   19
===================================
Container is ready to serve traffic
===================================
```

### Health Check Response
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/health.php
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-21T12:35:00Z"}
```

## Deploying to Render

Once local testing passes:

### 1. Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enhanced deployment with comprehensive error logging and validation"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Monitor Render Deployment

Watch the Render logs carefully. You should see:
- Build completing successfully
- Container starting with the new banner
- Clear startup progress messages
- "Container is ready to serve traffic"

### 3. If Deployment Fails

**Look for the error pattern in Render logs:**

- **Config test failed** â†’ Check that all files were committed
- **PHP-FPM died** â†’ Check for missing PHP extensions or permission errors
- **Nginx failed** â†’ Verify nginx config syntax
- **Exited with status 2** â†’ Look at the logs right before the exit for the actual error

**Run diagnostics if shell access available:**
```bash
/usr/local/bin/debug-startup.sh
```

### 4. Verify Health
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health.php
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Container starts but health check fails

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
docker exec prism-test curl http://127.0.0.1/health.php
docker exec prism-test ps aux | grep nginx
docker exec prism-test ps aux | grep php-fpm
```

**Solution:** Check that both services are running and ports are correct

---

### Issue: "PHP-FPM not ready" warnings

**This is usually fine if:**
- It eventually says "PHP-FPM is ready"
- Services start successfully afterward

**It's a problem if:**
- It says "PHP-FPM process has died"
- The wait times out after 20 attempts

**Solution:** Check PHP-FPM logs for extension loading errors or config issues

---

### Issue: Database connection errors during startup

**This is expected if:**
- Database isn't ready yet
- You're testing without a database

**It becomes a problem only if:**
- The application fails to handle it gracefully
- Users can't connect once DB is ready

**Note:** The migration step may fail during startup but the container will continue to run. The application should retry database connections.
